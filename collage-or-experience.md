Let’s be honest, there is a little voice that starts shouting in every person’s head near the end of their mandatory schooling…” what the heck am I going to do!”. Don’t feel bad, you are not alone. If you are lucky enough to access the necessary basic education, you will need to decide on a course of action, whether pursuing further academics, or straight into the workforce. This is an even greater headache as a young, green, and prospective entrepreneur. Which route is, the right one? 

Often, aspiring entrepreneurs will look to social media for the answer, and oh boy, do a lot of people, have a lot of opinions.

The cliché image that’s a common trope online is the rags to riches entrepreneur who pulled themselves out of their situation. Now, there are many highly successful figures for this is true, who have born into mundane or troubled backgrounds, with no academic opportunities , think: Richard Branson ( Barely finished High school), Do Won Chang(Worked as barista to get by) , Leonardo Del Vecchio(Apprenticed as a tool and die maker) , Sheldon Adelson(Dropped out of trade school then joined the army) , Farrah Gray(Grew up near the poverty line) and the awe-inspiring story of Mary Ellen Pleasant (Born a slave and  forbidden from receiving education). These incredible figures leveraged experience, mentorship, and opportunity, rather than academics. So, does this imply that university /Higher education is a scam, created by Big Edu?  Well, arguably no.

Like avocado on toast, there is always another slice. There are many cases of incredibly successful businessmen and woman, who, either used the work environment to their advantage, or jumped straight into their own venture. Some big names in this space include Michael Bloomberg (Bachelor of Engineering /MBA), Mukesh Ambani (Bachelor of Engineering /MBA), Steven Ballmer (BSc of Applied mathematics), David Steward (BS degree in business) and Susanne Klatten (Bachelor of Economist /MBA).
When considering either of these options, for this scenario, we will assume equal opportunity and access, which sadly often than not, false. There are circumstances such as prejudice, socio-economic status can dictate the opportunity to pursue higher education or business ventures.
In the spirit of being objective, lets way the advantages and disadvantages of both:

**Pros & Cons of College**

- Access to knowledge and resources
- Statistically more likely to earn more (outside of entrepreneurship)
- Pursuing a passion or profession of specialized sector (Medicine, engineering, sciences, and research)
- Prestige and accolades
- Dependant on academic achievement
- Many majors focus on creating employees, rather than employers.
- Expensive
- Linear thinking & Learning
- Often lack of industry exposure

**Pros and Cons of Experience**

- No tuition to start.
- Real world experience
- Immediate financial gain
- Mentorship from on the ground entrepreneurs
- Generally lower Nett worth
- High risk
- If success is not achieved, No Notoriety
- Can lead to dead-end position /Payrate.
- Cannot enter certain professions (Medicine, Research or Engineering)

So, which do you choose?

Like every fence sitter will tell you, there is no right answer. We can muddy the waters even further, by saying, that these are not your only two options, nor are they mutually exclusive. You can delay studies to pursue academics later or study an in-demand degree as a backup, before trying your hand in business.
A criminally under discussed option: Trade-School, Apprenticeship or Traineeships which offers many overlooked opportunities in terms of income, immigration, and entrepreneurship.

Honestly, the choice is completely determined by your personal affinity. The only absolute in this decision, is of course, another over used cliché: Play to your strengths!
