We are all enslaved by the mindset of this world, 9 to 5, cubicle, and the office cooler till age 65. Now why would I say something like that, you might ask?
Well let’s be honest, we always end up choosing the path of least resistance. It must be working; everyone is doing it!

So, we start our designated career, work our fingers to the bone but feel like kids at the end of the month, with an allowance you can't do much with, nor have much freedom.

Have you ever considered breaking the cycle?

The majority will answer…NO!

Listening to my friend, sharing their life experiences, as well as long last dreams that went down the pipes has a familiar ring to my ears.

Then there are the few that took a chance, choosing the road less travelled.  We don't see them often as they are too busy living their best life with back-to-back travel, country hopping and adventure.

If this appeal to you, shouldn’t you ask yourself:

- How do they survive financially? or how can they afford this lifestyle?
- Wouldn't it be wiser to follow the trend, and use your prime to build a nest egg for your golden years?
- When you retire you will have all the time and money to travel the world…
- The more you reflect on these questions, the more you may be drawn towards the group of people best known as the Digital Nomads.
- The more I contemplated the more I understood their game plan. An air of brilliance can be detected.

For most of humanity, our most productive years are between 20 years and 50 years of age, sometimes even longer depending on the choices you make during your life. You are still full of energy as well as curiosity. You are likely fit to travel and usually without any underlying health issues or obligations that are tying you down.

Digital Nomads work and earn an income remotely, enjoying the opportunity to tour and exploring. They determine their working hours, the location of their workspace, the people they surround themselves with and breaks times.

Regarding the nest egg for their golden years, it totally rests on themselves. Just like the normal office folks.

If you decide to embrace the Digital Nomad path, there are two possible routes that you can take: Remote work or Entrepreneurship.

The fastest route to a Nomadic Lifestyle is to seek out a remote position.  There are many sectors and disciplines which can be remotely undertaken. The most popular are Developers, Administration, Digital Marketing, Sales, Education, Content Creation and Research. Its important to note that this is not an exhaustive list. There are many sites and resources to help you on your journey, these include: Growmotely™, Flexjobs™, RemoteOK™ or Glassdoor™.

The other option (And un-surprisingly a favourite of SEM Monks) is the Entrepreneurial route. The road often less travelled, if carried out correctly, this can lead down a longer term, highly profitable and independent route. This may involve one of two groups: Freelancing, and Consultancy. If this appeals to you, check out sites such as Fiverr™ and Upwork™.  The more esoteric route maybe digital assets/products, financial trading, or Ecommerce. 

The choice is yours!

When we think of successful Digital Nomads like Mike Elgan, Tim Ferriss, Christine Gilbert, Chris Guillebeau, Matt Kepnes, Cody McKibben, Rolf Potts, Luis Suarez, Lea & Jonathan Woodward to name a few, we see great success.

Saving your adventures for your golden years might not be the wisest decision. As we grow older our bodies wear down. You might lack energy or mobility. I guess your only hope would be to age gracefully and still be able to travel like the young blood.

Being a Digital Nomad is the perfect opportunity for the vagabonds and for those who dare. Many of us have missed the opportunity to enjoy what we desire. Take a leap of faith. Trust yourself. Live your own adventures. and JUST DO IT ™.
