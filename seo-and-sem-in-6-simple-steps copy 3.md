## What is SEO & SEM exactly?

[SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide) refers to improvements to your website to help it rank higher on search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc when users see the [SERP (Search Engine Results Page)](https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/serp/) after searching by making it more relevant to your users. Organic or unpaid traffic to your site is generated here.

[SEM (Search Engine Marketing)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcontentmanagement/definition/Search-engine-marketing-SEM) refers to using paid online advertisement services (such as Google AdWords) that allow you to pay them to display advertisements on their platform. Inorganic or paid traffic to your site is generated here.

It helps to consider SEO & SEM as two facets to your digital or online efforts. [Google takes a website's user experience very seriously](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience#ranking) when calculating SEO score, and chances are if you are being penalized for SEO then it may be an issue to your marketing efforts.

Consider the following example: any advertisements to a slow page on your website become less effective because [people are more likely to click away instead of waiting for a page to load](https://www.google.co.za/search?q=how+many+people+click+away+from+a+site+if+it+takes+too+long+to+load). Any clicks away from advertisements due to slow load speed can be seen as a loss of potential revenue from your marketing efforts.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-mobile-abandonment-rates.jpg" description="Image of mobile site abandonment rate percentages for long load speeds"></article-image>

This is an SEO issue, and the solution is to find what is causing the slow down on your page load speed (possibly large & uncompressed files optimized for mobile) and optimize them thereby allowing your SEM efforts to stay effective. We'll cover tools to help you identify & fix issues in the next steps.

## Why does SEO & SEM matter to me?

Well, it depends. If you have no website nor online digital presence then it probably doesn't matter. But if you have a website, or a digital storefront, or even a social media page pertaining to your service offering - then it matters a lot.

SEO matters to your website's organic search rank. It helps you show up on search engines when people search for keywords related to a website. If the SEO for your site is set up poorly, then its ranking will be penalized and you are less likely to be found on search engines.

Our tool can be used to perform a site audit to check if there are any technical issues on your website penalizing its SEO rank - we try to give tips in simple English to help you understand and take actionable steps to improve your website's health. We offer a free tier subscription package with 1 report a month if you are curious to try us out - no strings attached.



<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/sem-monks-overview.jpg" description="Image of website report dashboard for our tool" ></article-image>

You can also make use of [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/) - a free tool offered by Google to run an audit on your site. A few of the suggestions may be a bit complex to implement for those not technically savvy at SEO optimization, but it offers a fantastic starting point to identify any red flags preventing your site from ranking competitively in organic search.

SEM matters to your digital marketing efforts. It helps your advertisements show up on search engines (Google, Bing, etc) when people search for advertisement's keywords. If your SEM is set up poorly, you are less likely to attract your target audience with your advertisements.

Google Search is an incredibly powerful search engine, and is very good at matching user intent when searching - so carefully crafted SEM advertisements will supercharge your online presence and give you that initial boost in growth and first interaction with your target audience - that proverbial foot in the door. They also boast the largest market share in the world in terms of search engines, as shown below from [StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/).


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/statcounter-google-search-engine-market-share.jpg" description="Image showing Google's market share as a Search Engine platform."></article-image>

We are leveraging [Google's massive market share of 93.37% of the search engine industry](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-202203-202303), and the fact that they are experts at matching user intent to relevant content when searching.

SEM can be an effective strategy of marketing your service offering to a largely untapped digital market that's only accessible through search engines like Google or Bing. It can help give your website that initial burst of growth and visibility it needs to succeed and start generating an online audience.

Instead of spending resources on advertising services that are usually limited or regionally locked to a geographic location, you can instead reach out to a much wider target audience by making use of search engines for your advertising needs.

## How do I get started with SEO/SEM?

Starting out with SEO can be overwhelming at first as SEO is a technically complex field, and albeit Google making it far more accessible to everyone through their [documentation and guides](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide), it still remains a difficult endeavor for the everyday individual to approach without a background in the subject.

We'll be going through a few factors that largely affect your website's SEO score, and these are things that you as an individual can realistically approach and implement with a little bit of elbow grease, a handful of clicks and a few minutes of your time. The factors are:

-   Performance
-   Accessibility
-   Best Practices
-   SEO

So to start off with we recommend performing a website audit through a free service such as [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), or a proprietary service such as [SEM Rush's site audit tool](https://www.semrush.com/features/site-audit/) but we recommend using something as a basis, and plenty of tools can be found online by searching.

In this guide we'll be using Google PageSpeed Insights which is a free tool to audit your website, as shown below:

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-overview.jpg" description="Image of Google PageSpeed Insights in action."></article-image>

### Performance

Performance acts as an indicator of how  fast, quick and responsive your website loads on a device. A low performance speed means longer load times which leads to higher abandonment rates. To avoid this and get the biggest boost in your performance, we recommend focusing on serving appropriately sized images.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-performance.jpg" description="Image of Performance metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

The two factors we want to focus on for images are:

-   Digital dimensions (example: 1980 by 1080 pixels)
-   File size (example: 512Kb)

You want to ensure that the digital dimensions of your images are large enough to display on all devices - desktop, tablet & mobile. Different dimensions exist for different platforms, such as the web, and [TinyIMG has a cheat sheet for quick reference](https://tiny-img.com/blog/best-image-size-for-website/#generally-recommended-image-sizes-for-websites). As an example, the best digital dimensions for a WordPress blog image on the web is 1600px wide by 630px  high [according to a quick Google search](https://www.google.co.za/search?q=best+image+size+for+wordpress+blog+post).

Various file formats exist for images, but we'll be focusing on two of the most well known, specifically JPEG & PNG files. JPEG files typically offer better compression rates, but PNG files retain detail and clarity to a greater degree. Typically JPEG is used for large photos and content whereas PNG is used for logos and media where a loss of quality would be too noticeable.

In order to change the dimensions and resolution of your images, we'll be using a free online tool called [Simple Image Resizer](https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/) which allows you to easily resize images:


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/simple-image-resizer-tool.jpg" description="Image of Simple Image Resizer for dimension resizing."></article-image>

Now that you have set appropriate dimensions for your image, we move onto file size reduction & compression, we'll be using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)  which allows you to upload and digitally compress image files for free. The only caveat is that there is a limit of twenty images per upload, although that is still more than enough for our needs. They do offer a pro mode if you enjoy their services.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/tiny-png-image-compression-tool.jpg" description="Image of TinyPNG for WebP, PNG & JPEG compression."></article-image>

###  Accessibility

Accessibility acts as a measure for how accessible your website is across all devices, platforms and demographics. In order to effectively serve everyone using Google as a search platform, they have taken steps to ensure aspects are considered to make the experience relevant to everyone. A step everyone can take is to add alternative attributes (or alt tags) to images.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-accessibility.jpg" description="Image of Accessibility metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

Alt text is using descriptive text that describes an image for visually impaired individuals, or for users who have low-bandwidth connections or screen readers, as to represent the image in a descriptive and relevant manner.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-alt-text-best-practices.jpg" description="Image of Google's suggestions of alt text with examples."></article-image>

To write good alt text, you have to ensure that it is descriptive and relevant to your content. An example to consider: If you are writing a guide on training dogs, an image of a dog misbehaving would be contextually relevant to the conversation. And Google will take this into account when crawling the page to get a better understanding of your content.

###  Best Practices

Best practices are just that - practices that ensure the experience is to the best quality possible to the end user. Many of the things here are rather technically complex, such as properly defining a charset, having a SSL certificate to ensure HTTPS, avoiding geolocation/notification permission on page load.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-best-practices.jpg" description="Image of Best Practices metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

Provided that you are using a reputable web master and they use competitive software to render & host your website, many of these best practices will already be in place to ensure that your site is not penalized for anything, but send the Google PageSpeed insights report to them with your concerns if you note something suspicious.

###  SEO

SEO is affected by a variety of factors, but one of the largest of these are keywords. Keywords are selected words or phrases that are commonly searched by the users of Search Engines like Google. Choosing well curated keywords that have active monthly searches and are relevant to your content is a very effective way to supercharge your SEO score. In order to do this we'll be performing keyword research, which will be covered in depth in step 4 of this guide.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-seo.jpg" description="Image of SEO metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

All of these aspects together impact your overall site score, and they often overlap, such as alt tags also improve SEO score although it's an accessibility metric. Hopefully this has given you actionable insights into your SEO for your website.

Getting started with SEM is slightly more straightforward, at least from the perspective we will be approaching it from. Google by a large margin owns most of the digital real estate in terms of search engines and we will leverage that fact to advertise your service offering on their search platform. Using [Google AdWords to set up a PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising campaign](https://ads.google.com/home/resources/seo-vs-ppc/).

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-mobile.jpg" description="Image of Google AdWords advertisement on a mobile phone display."></article-image>

Setting up a Google AdWords account is simple, you need a Google account to create and manage it. Sign up for an account here. Before getting into the actual campaign setup, we'll be taking a detour to do some keyword research to develop a keyword shortlist to make the Google AdWords campaign vastly more effective. That will be covered in step 4.

## Keyword Research with Google Keyword Planner

In order to perform keyword research with [Google's Keywords Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_za/home/tools/keyword-planner/) we need to identify your competitors, as we will be using them as the basis for generating your keywords. Take a moment to think of any 5 competitors that operate within your target market. Jot them down, and search for them on Google Search to record their website addresses. If you can't think of any competitors, search for your business category, product or services online and you will find a few examples. See the image below for a demonstration.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-search-seo-sem-agency.jpg" description="Image of Google Search Engine Results Pages searching for competitors."></article-image>

The next step is to navigate to [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_za/home/tools/keyword-planner/), as we will use the list of websites we have as the basis for our keyword ideas. You want to click the "Discover new keywords" button, and then click the "Start with a website tab" and then input one of the competitor websites and you should have a screen that looks something like the image below:


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-keyword-planner.jpg" description="Image of Google Keyword Planner with SEM Monks as the target website."></article-image>

Then after clicking "Get results" Google will then generate a list of keywords that the website ranks for, as displayed below:


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-keyword-planner-results.jpg" description="Image of Google Keyword Planner with keyword results for SEM Monks."></article-image>

And now we want to click the "Download keyword ideas" to save this data to Google Sheets for further filtering purposes later on. Continue to repeat this step for each website in order to have a total of  5 spreadsheets for each set of keywords. Opening up the spreadsheet should give you something akin to the image below.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-sheets-keywords-sem-monks.jpg" description="Image of Google Sheets with exported keyword ideas for SEM Monks."></article-image>

Now the next step is to filter down the data to reveal usable keywords that you can use for your own SEO needs. The two columns we are primarily interested in are avg. monthly searches and competition. We want keywords with low and medium competition, and keywords with avg. monthly searches of 500 or more.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-sheets-keywords-sem-monks-filtered.jpg" description="Image of Google Sheets with filtered keyword ideas for SEM Monks."></article-image>

Unfortunately as with the best laid plans - life happens. In our case we have no keywords with avg. monthly searches of 500 or more. If this happens, we recommend finding a similar website or replacement for the competitor.

This will filter down each list to usable keywords suited for your needs, but we want to compile these different spreadsheets into a single keyword reference spreadsheet. Copy over the data into a new spreadsheet, and then you should be left with a spreadsheet that looks similar to this:


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-sheets-keywords-sem-monks-master.jpg" description="Image of Google Sheets spreadsheet with master keyword reference list for SEM Monks."></article-image>

Now comes the time for you to get involved and choose your keywords. Take a moment and pick a color you like, and then proceed to fill the cells of the keywords that you want to target. We recommend trying to go for 30 keywords that are relevant to you to start your SEO journey.

Apply a color filter with your chosen color and voila, you have your curated list of keywords. Keep these keywords safe where you can refer to them. We will be using these keywords in the next step of setting up a SEM campaign through Google AdWords.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-sheets-keywords-sem-monks-shortlist.jpg" description="Image of Google Sheets spreadsheet with shortlist of 30 keywords filtered for SEM Monks."></article-image>

## Setting up your first Google AdWords campaign

We're going to assume you have a website, digital storefront or social media page where your advertisement can link to. If you do not, Google offers a service called [Google MyBusiness](https://www.google.com/business/) where you can register your business to be found on Google's platforms. It's free, and you only need a Google account to sign up for it.

Google will guide you through setting up an optimized advertisement for displaying on their platform. They give you guidelines in the form of an optimization score that you can influence by applying recommendations such as:

-   Adding keywords in your headlines, descriptions and callouts text.

-   Adding sitelinks & callouts to your advertisement.

-   Adding a phone number where clients can call and ask about the advertisement.

-   Setting up catchy headlines and writing engaging descriptions.

It's important to note that the optimization score should only be used as a guideline, and that the real testing begins when users actually see and interact with your advertisements. We recommend a score of 85% or higher from Google before launching your campaign.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-optimization-recommendations.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads optimization score for an ongoing campaign."></article-image>

We'll be guiding you through the process step by step with images to assist you with setting up your first Google AdWords campaign. So start by logging into [Google Ads](https://www.google.co.za/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiV8731x6b-AhXJ0-0KHfKEANYYABAAGgJkZw&sig=AOD64_2Q6PME_zPlHEoLD_V9QtIgUbudqg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjlibj1x6b-AhVTe8AKHXUVBQcQ0Qx6BAgIEAE), and to start you will want to click create a campaign without any guidance, and then select a search campaign.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-campaign-creation.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign creation without goal's guidance & search campaign type."></article-image>

Now you will see the campaign setup screen, with Bidding as the first section. We want to focus on clicks, as we'll cover conversions in a separate article, and ignore the maximum cost per click bid limit for now.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-bidding.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on bidding tab with clicks as a focus."></article-image>

Campaign settings will show you the networks you'll display on, and we recommend leaving both checked on, unless you have a specific reason for disabling it. In terms of locations you'll wish to target the locations you cater to. If you only provide your services to your people in your country, then select your country as a location to target so that your ads won't display to people in other countries.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-campaign-settings-network-location.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on network and locations tab."></article-image>

The next section is languages, and you should choose languages that you serve and cater to your audience. We'll be defaulting to English, as that is the language we engage, interact and serve our customers in.

Now onto your audiences section, as audiences are segments of Google's search base that you can select to display your advertisement to. Choose 3 to 5 audience segments you think is appropriate to your service offering. Leave the targeting on observation mode, and ignore automatically created assets for now.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-campaign-settings-languages-audiences.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on languages & audiences tab."></article-image>

Now onto the keywords and ads section, and this is where we'll be taking that curated shortlist of 30 keywords that you generated in Step 5 and copying it here. This shortlist of keywords will act as the basis of the advertisement's keywords, and since we have already filtered out irrelevant & low search volume keywords, setting up an effective advertisement will be a lot easier.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-campaign-settings-keywords.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on keywords and ads tab with 30 imported keywords."></article-image>

Google will guide you through setting up a good responsive search advertisement with headlines, descriptions, sitelinks, callouts and other assets designed to improve its performance. We recommend adding as much to this as possible because Google can optimize it for best performance.

Onto the budget section, of which we highly recommend a conservative approach. We are already targeting low competition, high search volume keywords with our shortlist of 30 keywords, so you will not be competing for the high ad positions with companies with far larger marketing budgets than yours. We started with a basis of $1.00 per day for a month to test the market for a total of $30.00.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-campaign-settings-budget.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup with a daily budget of $1.00 (approximately ZAR 15)  per day."></article-image>

And finally, the review section covers your advertisement to show any  issues, recommendations, overview, bidding info, campaign settings, ads & budget to give you a top level overview of your campaign before you launch it.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-campaign-settings-review.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on review tab with Google optimization recommendations at the top."></article-image>

Now provided you have no outstanding issues or recommendations - you should be good to launch your campaign, and reach your digital audience at the click of a button.

## What's Next & Campaign Aftercare

Now that you have your first Google AdWords campaign set up and running with optimized SEO keywords to display advertisements to your customers, you're probably wondering - well, now what?

So there is still a fair bit to do in terms of campaign monitoring and aftercare which we will cover in this section. Carefully monitoring your campaign during its time live is just as important as the initial setup of the campaign, and as such we recommend that you [install the Google Ads application on your smartphone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adwords&hl=en_US) to easily manage and access your Google AdWords campaigns from your pocket.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-and-sem-in-6-simple-steps/google-ads-google-play.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads in Google Play Store to install on iOS/Android smartphones."></article-image>

We recommend running this starter campaign for a period of 1 month, and [then using Google's checklist](https://ads.google.com/home/resources/how-to-setup-googleads-a-checklist/) to ensure that your campaign is performing effectively. With this technique your Google AdWords will bring you the best bang for your buck. To start with, you will want to sit down and review your campaign at the following dates after launching the campaign:

-   1 day
-   1 week
-   2 weeks
-   3 weeks
-   4 weeks
-   Campaign end

After doing this once or twice, you will already have optimized your campaign a great deal as to allow you access to your audience at the lowest CPC (cost per click) possible. At the end of the campaign when you wrap it all up, you will have a list of vetted keywords that have been tested from your Google Ads campaign that you can use for your own SEO needs. Set a notification somewhere to remind you of these dates, and at each time you will [consider the following list from Google](https://ads.google.com/home/resources/how-to-setup-googleads-a-checklist/) and use it as a basis to improve your campaign.

Thank you for taking the time to read this article, and if you have any feedback, please [send us a message via our contact form](https://semmonks.com/contact) on our website for any questions or queries, we're always happy to hear from you.
