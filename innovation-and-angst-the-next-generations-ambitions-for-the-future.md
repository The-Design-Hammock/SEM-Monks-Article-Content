When it comes to Millennials and Generation Z, they have heard it all “why are you always on your phone!” or once again “Back in my Day “.  Are these sentiments fair, or do the youngsters have something to offer?

Should everyone be scared or excited about these kids? 

Let’s take a look and see what the youngsters are all about. 

As you know, Millennials are the kids’ That are born between 1980s and early1990s. Growing up with the advent of personal computing, mobile phones and a whole lot of information… a whole lot. Millennials are the go-to guys for any laptop issue or Wi-Fi catastrophe. This is arguable the first generation that had the world at their fingertips. 

Gen Z are the newest edition, or better yet the coming soon kids. These youngsters born at the tail end of the late 90s to 2000s, being dubbed the “Digital Natives”. These techno champs had access to Candy Crush™, smart technology and many of the social media platforms, post growing pains… let’s not forget Myspace or Floppy disks.

Now, the golden question: what do these kids have to offer?

Millennials, and soon Gen Z have the odds a little stacked against them, this is putting it mildly. The last few decades have been filled with an increased cost of living, housing crisis, economic stagnation, and the Tide Pod™ challenge. 

The insanity of this day and age hasn’t broken the spirit of these kids, who have showed a penchant for innovation. How so? Well let’s start with an example: Mark Zuckerburg, the founder of Facebook™ as well as the king of the awkward nerd’s association. Mark revolutionized the way we interact and share personal information in a way no social media or website was able to do before. He was not the first to do so, but his innovative features and designed allowed the individual to both connect with friends and family, but more so create a profile that (even if only in the eye of the creator) truly represented them. Facebooks has also monetized data, while continuous upgrading: Market place, Games, and advertising. Facebook, like its Peer Google, prioritizes progress and development, over dogma and tradition.

The drive for change that the kids aspire to is not limited to technology or industry. There has been a social shift, with a focus on human rights, diversity, and mental health. The focus on social progress, although spearheaded decades before (Martin Luther, Harvey Milk and Mandela),has millennials and Gen Z focusing less on social change, but rather on normalizing progressive values. Millennials have endeavoured to create workspaces that foster productivity as a by-product of comfort and metal wellbeing.  Although many of the social changes, have been controversial, spirit in which is its done, is not.

We can see the real-world application of both progressive social and economic ideas touted by the youngsters in places like Estonia, whom, since its independence in 1991, went from one of the poorest former Soviet states, to the republic with the highest number of Unicorn start-ups and advanced telecommunication infrastructure in the world.  Estonia has seen great success through the incorporation of smart devices and progressive values. Another example includes the Nordic nations which boast the highest rankings in terms of overall happiness (World Happiness Index). 

Well, only time will tell what the millennials have up their sleave. The same goes for Gen Z, who haven’t yet had their time to shine. Both have shown an affinity for innovation and progress. With their access to ever advancing technology and ideas, we might be near some great advances. Let’s give them a chance, kids these days, might just make us all proud.
