## 1. What is SEO & why does it matter?

[Search Engine Optimization (SEO)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide) refers to improvements to your website to help it rank higher on search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc when users reach the [Search Engine Results Pages (SERP)](https://mailchimp.com/marketing-glossary/serp/) after searching their query by making it more relevant to your users. Organic or unpaid traffic to your digital platform is generated here.

SEO is one of many aspects to your digital or online efforts. [Google takes user experience very seriously](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience#ranking) when calculating SEO score, and chances are that if you are being penalized for this it may be an issue to your business being found online.

Consider the following example: any links to a slow page on your website become less effective because [people are more likely to click away instead of waiting for a page to load - especially on a mobile device](https://www.google.co.za/search?q=how+many+people+click+away+from+a+site+if+it+takes+too+long+to+load). Any users lost due to a slow page can be seen as a loss of potential audience engaging with your content.


<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-in-3-simple-steps/google-mobile-abandonment-rates.jpg" description="Image of mobile site abandonment rates."></article-image>

This is largely an SEO issue, and the solution is relatively simple - find what is causing the slowdown in your page load speed (probably large & unoptimized media files) and to use a platform to optimize them thereby allowing your site to stay effective in SERP rankings by Google.

Onto the question of whether SEO matters or not. Well, it depends. If you have no website nor online digital presence then it probably doesn't matter to you. But if you have a website, or a digital storefront, or even a social media page pertaining to you or your service offering - then it matters a lot. SEO matters to your website's organic search rank. It helps you show up on search engines when people search for keywords related to your content. If the SEO for your site is set up poorly, then its ranking will be penalized and you are less likely to be found on search engines.

Google Search is an incredibly powerful search engine, and is very good at matching user intent when searching - so carefully crafted SEM advertisements will supercharge your online presence and give you that initial boost in growth and first interaction with your target audience - that proverbial foot in the door. They also boast the largest market share in the world in terms of search engines, as shown below from [StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/).

We are leveraging [Google's massive market share of 93.37% of the search engine industry](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-202203-202303), and the fact that they are experts at matching user intent to relevant content when searching.

## 2. Optimizing Images with TinyPNG & Simple Image Resizer

The two factors we want to focus on for images are:

-   Digital dimensions (example: 1980 by 1080 pixels)
-   File size (example: 512Kb)

You want to ensure that the digital dimensions of your images are large enough to display on all devices - desktop, tablet & mobile. Different dimensions exist for different platforms, such as the web, and [TinyIMG has a cheat sheet for quick reference](https://tiny-img.com/blog/best-image-size-for-website/#generally-recommended-image-sizes-for-websites). As an example, the best digital dimensions for a WordPress blog image on the web is 1600px wide by 630px high [according to a quick Google search](https://www.google.co.za/search?q=best+image+size+for+wordpress+blog+post).

Various file formats exist for images, but we'll be focusing on two of the most well known, specifically JPEG & PNG files. JPEG files typically offer better compression rates, but PNG files retain detail and clarity to a greater degree. Typically JPEG is used for large photos and content whereas PNG is used for logos and media where a loss of quality would be too noticeable.

In order to change the dimensions and resolution of your images, we'll be using a free online tool called [Simple Image Resizer](https://www.simpleimageresizer.com/) which allows you to easily resize images.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-in-3-simple-steps/simple-image-resizer-tool.jpg" description="Image of Simple Image Resizer for dimension resizing."></article-image>

Now that you have set appropriate dimensions for your image, we move onto file size reduction & compression, we'll be using [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) which allows you to upload and digitally compress image files for free. The only caveat is that there is a limit of twenty images per upload, although that is still more than enough for our needs. They do offer a pro mode if you enjoy their services.

## 3. Getting Started with SEO
Starting out with SEO can be overwhelming at first as SEO is a technically complex field, and albeit Google making it far more accessible to everyone through their [documentation and guides](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide), it still remains a difficult endeavor for the everyday individual to approach without a background in the subject.

We'll be going through a few factors that largely affect your website's SEO score, and these are things that you as an individual can realistically approach and implement with a little bit of elbow grease, a handful of clicks and a few minutes of your time. The factors are:

-   Performance
-   Accessibility
-   Best Practices
-   SEO

So to start off with we recommend performing a website audit through a free service such as [Google's PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/), or a proprietary service such as [SEM Rush's site audit tool](https://www.semrush.com/features/site-audit/) but we recommend using something as a basis, and plenty of tools can be found online by searching.

In this guide we'll be using Google PageSpeed Insights which is a free tool to audit your website, as shown below:

### 3.1 Performance

Performance acts as an indicator of how fast, quick and responsive your website loads on a device. A low performance speed means longer load times which leads to higher abandonment rates. To avoid this and get the biggest boost in your performance, we recommend focusing on serving appropriately sized images.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-in-3-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-performance.jpg" description="Image of Performance metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

Refer to step 2 of this guide for optimizing images.

### 3.2 Accessibility

Accessibility acts as a measure for how accessible your website is across all devices, platforms and demographics. In order to effectively serve everyone using Google as a search platform, they have taken steps to ensure aspects are considered to make the experience relevant to everyone. A step everyone can take is to add alternative attributes (or alt tags) to images.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-in-3-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-accessibility.jpg" description="Image of Accessibility metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

Alt text is using descriptive text that describes an image for visually impaired individuals, or for users who have low-bandwidth connections or screen readers, as to represent the image in a descriptive and relevant manner.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-in-3-simple-steps/google-alt-text-best-practices.jpg" description="Image of Google's suggestions of alt text with examples."></article-image>

To write good alt text, you have to ensure that it is descriptive and relevant to your content. An example to consider: If you are writing a guide on training dogs, an image of a dog misbehaving would be contextually relevant to the conversation. And Google will take this into account when crawling the page to get a better understanding of your content.

### 3.3 Best Practices

Best practices are just that - practices that ensure the experience is to the best quality possible to the end user. Many of the things here are rather technically complex, such as properly defining a charset, having a SSL certificate to ensure HTTPS, avoiding geolocation/notification permission on page load.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-in-3-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-best-practices.jpg" description="Image of Best Practices metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

Provided that you are using a reputable web master and they use competitive software to render & host your website, many of these best practices will already be in place to ensure that your site is not penalized for anything, but send the Google PageSpeed insights report to them with your concerns if you note something suspicious.

### 3.4 SEO

SEO is affected by a variety of factors, but one of the largest of these are keywords. Keywords are selected words or phrases that are commonly searched by the users of Search Engines like Google. Choosing well curated keywords that have active monthly searches and are relevant to your content is a very effective way to supercharge your SEO score. In order to do this we'll be performing keyword research, which will be covered in depth in step 4 of this guide.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/seo-in-3-simple-steps/google-pagespeed-insights-seo.jpg" description="Image of SEO metric in Google PageSpeed insights."></article-image>

All of these aspects together impact your overall site score, and they often overlap, such as alt tags also improve SEO score although it's an accessibility metric. Hopefully this has given you actionable insights into your SEO for your website.
