A Search Engine Results Page (SERP) is a list of outcomes provided by a search engine when a user enters a particular word or keyword phrase. We’ve all seen them before when searching for anything on Google.

The top-ranking results on the SERP are typically those deemed most relevant or are paid placements by websites looking for prime visibility. With their sophisticated algorithms, search engines arrange the content on the page in a way that makes the links less relevant as a user scrolls down.

## What are common SERP features?

SERP features are the other elements of a result page that go beyond the common “blue links” that we are so used to. These include

### Sponsored ads

Sponsored adverts are paid advertisements that appear on search engine results pages and other online platforms. They are usually marked as "sponsored" to indicate they are promotional content. Advertisers pay to have their ads displayed to a targeted audience, aiming to increase visibility, attract potential customers, and promote their products or services effectively.

### Related searches

Local Packs display info about nearby businesses and a Google Maps map. They appear for location-based searches, showing different results depending on the searcher's location. For example, a search for "SEO agency" in London will display a number of agencies that are based in London.

### Featured snippets

Highlighted text extractions that appear at the top of search results pages are known as "Featured Snippets". These featured snippets are also known as “position 0” as they are the first thing a user sees. The snippets offer searchers a quick response to their search inquiries, providing concise answers. Informational search queries are more likely to trigger the appearance of these featured snippets.

### People Also Ask

The "People Also Ask" section is an interesting feature on search engine results pages that shows additional related questions, often in an expandable format. It offers users the opportunity to explore further queries relevant to their original search, providing more in-depth information and enhancing the search experience.

### Knowledge panels

Knowledge panels are handy boxes on search engines that provide summarised information about a topic or entity. They appear on the right side of search results and offer quick facts, images, and links to related details. It's essentially a cheat sheet, making it easy to learn about topics without clicking around too much!

## Why are SERPs important for websites?

SERPs have always been an important factor for online businesses as they can have a significant effect on how successful your company is. They are vital for any digital entity as they can determine a number of vital factors, including


### Visibility and Traffic

SERPs determine a business's online visibility and organic traffic, as higher rankings attract more users searching for relevant products or services.
