SEO stands as a paramount website optimisation strategy, with great content, backlinks, and meta descriptions playing crucial roles. However, neglecting website performance can undermine these efforts. Slow loading times and display issues can deter visitors, leading them to opt for competitors.

Here, we delve into the world of website performance and give you a few tips on how you can ensure your site is in tip-top shape. This is more of a technical guide, so brace yourselves.

## What is website performance?

In digital marketing, website performance generally refers to how fast a web page loads and displays content. It’s all part of visitors’ experience and it’s key to online success.

Website performance can also be used more generally, to refer to the overall impact a website has on a business. However, when digital marketers talk about website performance, we’re usually talking about how fast a site loads.

Website performance can be measured by the number of server errors and the size of downloaded web pages. It might also be called page load time.

Website performance and page speed are imperative for any online business. A slow website can lead to:

- Loss of sales
- Lost conversions
- Unhappy customers
- Damage to your brand’s reputation
- Lower ranking in the SERPs

Just how long does the average customer wait for a page to load? Not long.

Most sources say a website should load within two seconds. Anything longer and you risk losing not just traffic but customers. You can check your website’s speed with the very handy PageSpeed Insights tool.

Now that we know what website performance is, let’s take a look at ways that we can improve it and supercharge our SEO.

## Optimising images

Images play a crucial role in website performance as they directly impact page weight and loading times. Optimising website images can significantly improve loading speed and enhance user experience.

Determining optimal image sizes varies based on each picture's requirements. A helpful resource for guidance is the Strikingly website image size cheat sheet.

Here are image guidelines to enhance website performance:

Crop images to fit within the screen boundaries.
Use images sparingly to expedite page loading.
Utilise a page ruler for precise dimensions.
Employ image compression tools and plugins.

However, focusing on image size alone is not enough; also consider aspects like formatting, resolution, dimensions, and quality. By striking the right balance and minimising image usage, you can ensure that website images positively impact UI without compromising performance.]

## Rethink your website hosting plan

The website hosting plan you originally selected for your site may have been ideal a few years ago, but as your site gains attention and traffic surges, it may no longer meet your needs.

This can lead to frequent downtime, reduced website performance, and frustration for both you and your visitors. To address this, consider upgrading to a plan that caters to your growing audience.

If you currently use a shared hosting plan, explore alternatives like dedicated website servers. These servers provide a fast and reliable web connection, with scalability to handle high traffic and bandwidth demands. While they may be more expensive than shared hosting, they offer superior site performance. This is because dedicated servers allocate all resources to a single website, ensuring optimal performance and responsiveness.

## Cut down HTTP requests

HTTP requests are foundational to the web, enabling web browsers to seek information from servers and display it on webpages.

When visiting a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server for data. The server responds with essential information like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, allowing your browser to render the page.

To ensure quick page loading, minimise HTTP requests from the server to the browser. Reduce requests through various methods:

Optimise image size and convert it into a modern format such as Webp.
Optimise JavaScript and CSS files.
Merge multiple JS files.
Use a Content Distribution Network (CDN) to distribute content efficiently.

Redirects can also hinder website performance, taking users from one page to another. Excessive or invalid redirects can negatively impact ranking and site speed.

## Mitigate redirects


When it comes to optimising website performance and ensuring a smooth user experience, mitigating redirects is of utmost importance. Redirects can affect page loading times and even impact search engine rankings. To streamline your website's redirection process, consider implementing a series of effective strategies.

To mitigate redirects:

- Implement a 301 permanent redirect to inform Google of the new page and direct traffic there.
- Add canonical tags to manage duplicate content.
- Remove old redirects.
