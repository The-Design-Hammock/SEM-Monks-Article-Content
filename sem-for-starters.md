## 1. What is SEM exactly?

[SEM (Search Engine Marketing)](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcontentmanagement/definition/Search-engine-marketing-SEM) refers to using paid online advertisement services (such as Google AdWords) that allow you to pay them to display advertisements on their platform. Inorganic or paid traffic to your site is generated here.

It helps to consider SEM as one of many facets to your digital or online efforts.Â  Consider the following example: any advertisements to a slow page on your website become less effective because [people are more likely to click away instead of waiting for a page to load](https://www.google.co.za/search?q=how+many+people+click+away+from+a+site+if+it+takes+too+long+to+load). Any clicks away from advertisements due to slow load speed can be seen as a loss of potential revenue from your marketing efforts.

SEM can be an effective strategy of marketing your service offering to a largely untapped digital market that's only accessible through search engines like Google or Bing. It can help give your website that initial burst of growth and visibility it needs to succeed and start generating an online audience.

Instead of spending resources on advertising services that are usually limited or regionally locked to a geographic location, you can instead reach out to a much wider target audience by making use of search engines for your advertising needs.

## 2. Why does SEM matter to me?

SEM matters to your digital marketing efforts. It helps your advertisements show up on search engines (Google, Bing, etc) when people search for advertisement's keywords. If your SEM is set up poorly, you are less likely to attract your target audience with your advertisements.

Google Search is an incredibly powerful search engine, and is very good at matching user intent when searching - so carefully crafted SEM advertisements will supercharge your online presence and give you that initial boost in growth and first interaction with your target audience - that proverbial foot in the door. They also boast the largest market share in the world in terms of search engines, as shown below from [StatCounter](https://gs.statcounter.com/).

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/statcounter-google-search-engine-market-share.jpg" description="Image showing Google's market share as a Search Engine platform."></article-image>


We are leveraging [Google's massive market share of 93.37% of the search engine industry](https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share#monthly-202203-202303), and the fact that they are experts at matching user intent to relevant content when searching.

## 3. How do I get started with SEM?

Getting started with SEM is slightly more straightforward, at least from the perspective we will be approaching it from. Google by a large margin owns most of the digital real estate in terms of search engines and we will leverage that fact to advertise your service offering on their search platform. Using [Google AdWords to set up a PPC (Pay Per Click) advertising campaign](https://ads.google.com/home/resources/seo-vs-ppc/).

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-mobile.jpg" description="Image of Google AdWords advertisement on a mobile phone display."></article-image>

Setting up a Google AdWords account is simple, you need a Google account to create and manage it. Sign up for an account here. Before getting into the actual campaign setup, we'll be taking a detour to do some keyword research to develop a keyword shortlist to make the Google AdWords campaign vastly more effective. That will be covered in step 4.

## 4. Keyword Research with Google Keyword Planner

In order to perform keyword research with [Google's Keywords Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_za/home/tools/keyword-planner/) we need to identify your competitors, as we will be using them as the basis for generating your keywords. Take a moment to think of any 5 competitors that operate within your target market. Jot them down, and search for them on Google Search to record their website addresses. If you can't think of any competitors, search for your business category, product or services online and you will find a few examples. See the image below for a demonstration.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-search-seo-sem-agency.jpg" description="Image of Google Search Engine Results Pages searching for competitors."></article-image>

The next step is to navigate to [Google Keyword Planner](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_za/home/tools/keyword-planner/), as we will use the list of websites we have as the basis for our keyword ideas. You want to click the "Discover new keywords" button, and then click the "Start with a website tab" and then input one of the competitor websites and you should have a screen that looks something like the image below:

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-keyword-planner.jpg" description="Image of Google Keyword Planner with SEM Monks as the target website."></article-image>

Then after clicking "Get results" Google will then generate a list of keywords that the website ranks for, as displayed below:

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-keyword-planner-results.jpg" description="Image of Google Keyword Planner with keyword results for SEM Monks."></article-image>

And now we want to click the "Download keyword ideas" to save this data to Google Sheets for further filtering purposes later on. Continue to repeat this step for each website in order to have a total of 5 spreadsheets for each set of keywords. Opening up the spreadsheet should give you something akin to the image below.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-sheets-keywords-sem-monks.jpg" description="Image of Google Sheets with exported keyword ideas for SEM Monks."></article-image>

Now the next step is to filter down the data to reveal usable keywords that you can use for your own SEO needs. The two columns we are primarily interested in are avg. monthly searches and competition. We want keywords with low and medium competition, and keywords with avg. monthly searches of 500 or more.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-sheets-keywords-sem-monks-filtered.jpg" description="Image of Google Sheets with filtered keyword ideas for SEM Monks."></article-image>

Unfortunately as with the best laid plans - life happens. In our case we have no keywords with avg. monthly searches of 500 or more. If this happens, we recommend finding a similar website or replacement for the competitor.

This will filter down each list to usable keywords suited for your needs, but we want to compile these different spreadsheets into a single keyword reference spreadsheet. Copy over the data into a new spreadsheet, and then you should be left with a spreadsheet that looks similar to this:

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-sheets-keywords-sem-monks-master.jpg" description="Image of Google Sheets spreadsheet with master keyword reference list for SEM Monks."></article-image>

Now comes the time for you to get involved and choose your keywords. Take a moment and pick a color you like, and then proceed to fill the cells of the keywords that you want to target. We recommend trying to go for 30 keywords that are relevant to you to start your SEO journey.

Apply a color filter with your chosen color and voila, you have your curated list of keywords. Keep these keywords safe where you can refer to them. We will be using these keywords in the next step of setting up a SEM campaign through Google AdWords.

## 5. Setting up your first Google AdWords campaign

We're going to assume you have a website, digital storefront or social media page where your advertisement can link to. If you do not, Google offers a service called [Google MyBusiness](https://www.google.com/business/) where you can register your business to be found on Google's platforms. It's free, and you only need a Google account to sign up for it.

Google will guide you through setting up an optimized advertisement for displaying on their platform. They give you guidelines in the form of an optimization score that you can influence by applying recommendations such as:

-   Adding keywords in your headlines, descriptions and callouts text.
-   Adding sitelinks & callouts to your advertisement.
-   Adding a phone number where clients can call and ask about the advertisement.
-   Setting up catchy headlines and writing engaging descriptions.

It's important to note that the optimization score should only be used as a guideline, and that the real testing begins when users actually see and interact with your advertisements. We recommend a score of 85% or higher from Google before launching your campaign.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-optimization-recommendations.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads optimization score for an ongoing campaign."></article-image>

We'll be guiding you through the process step by step with images to assist you with setting up your first Google AdWords campaign. So start by logging into [Google Ads](https://www.google.co.za/aclk?sa=l&ai=DChcSEwiV8731x6b-AhXJ0-0KHfKEANYYABAAGgJkZw&sig=AOD64_2Q6PME_zPlHEoLD_V9QtIgUbudqg&q&adurl&ved=2ahUKEwjlibj1x6b-AhVTe8AKHXUVBQcQ0Qx6BAgIEAE), and to start you will want to click create a campaign without any guidance, and then select a search campaign.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-campaign-creation.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign creation without goal's guidance & search campaign type."></article-image>

Now you will see the campaign setup screen, with Bidding as the first section. We want to focus on clicks, as we'll cover conversions in a separate article, and ignore the maximum cost per click bid limit for now.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-bidding.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on bidding tab with clicks as a focus."></article-image>

Campaign settings will show you the networks you'll display on, and we recommend leaving both checked on, unless you have a specific reason for disabling it. In terms of locations you'll wish to target the locations you cater to. If you only provide your services to your people in your country, then select your country as a location to target so that your ads won't display to people in other countries.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-campaign-settings-network-location.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on network and locations tab."></article-image>

The next section is languages, and you should choose languages that you serve and cater to your audience. We'll be defaulting to English, as that is the language we engage, interact and serve our customers in.

Now onto your audiences section, as audiences are segments of Google's search base that you can select to display your advertisement to. Choose 3 to 5 audience segments you think is appropriate to your service offering. Leave the targeting on observation mode, and ignore automatically created assets for now.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-campaign-settings-languages-audiences.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on languages & audiences tab."></article-image>

Now onto the keywords and ads section, and this is where we'll be taking that curated shortlist of 30 keywords that you generated in Step 5 and copying it here. This shortlist of keywords will act as the basis of the advertisement's keywords, and since we have already filtered out irrelevant & low search volume keywords, setting up an effective advertisement will be a lot easier.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-campaign-settings-keywords.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on keywords and ads tab with 30 imported keywords."></article-image>

Google will guide you through setting up a good responsive search advertisement with headlines, descriptions, sitelinks, callouts and other assets designed to improve its performance. We recommend adding as much to this as possible because Google can optimize it for best performance.

Onto the budget section, of which we highly recommend a conservative approach. We are already targeting low competition, high search volume keywords with our shortlist of 30 keywords, so you will not be competing for the high ad positions with companies with far larger marketing budgets than yours. We started with a basis of $1.00 per day for a month to test the market for a total of $30.00.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-campaign-settings-budget.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup with a daily budget of $1.00 (approximately ZAR 15)Â  per day."></article-image>

And finally, the review section covers your advertisement to show any issues, recommendations, overview, bidding info, campaign settings, ads & budget to give you a top level overview of your campaign before you launch it.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-campaign-settings-review.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads campaign setup on review tab with Google optimization recommendations at the top."></article-image>

Now provided you have no outstanding issues or recommendations - you should be good to launch your campaign, and reach your digital audience at the click of a button.

## 6. Campaign launch & aftercare

Now that you have your first Google AdWords campaign set up and running with optimized SEO keywords to display advertisements to your customers, you're probably wondering - well what now?

So there is still a fair bit to do in terms of campaign monitoring and aftercare which we will cover in this section. Carefully monitoring your campaign during its time live is just as important as the initial setup of the campaign, and as such we recommend that you [install the Google Ads application on your smartphone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adwords&hl=en_US) to easily manage and access your Google AdWords campaigns from your pocket.

<article-image rel="norefer" target="_blank" link="" path="/images/articles/sem-for-starters/google-ads-google-play.jpg" description="Image of Google Ads in Google Play Store to install on iOS/Android smartphones."></article-image>

We recommend running this starter campaign for a period of 1 month, and [then using Google's checklist](https://ads.google.com/home/resources/how-to-setup-googleads-a-checklist/) to ensure that your campaign is performing effectively. With this technique your Google AdWords will bring you the best bang for your buck. To start with, you will want to sit down and review your campaign at the following dates after launching the campaign:

-   1 day
-   1 week
-   2 weeks
-   3 weeks
-   4 weeks
-   Campaign end

After doing this once or twice, you will already have optimized your campaign a great deal as to allow you access to your audience at the lowest CPC (cost per click) possible. At the end of the campaign when you wrap it all up, you will have a list of vetted keywords that have been tested from your Google Ads campaign that you can use for your own SEO needs. Set a notification somewhere to remind you of these dates, and at each time you will [consider the following list from Google](https://ads.google.com/home/resources/how-to-setup-googleads-a-checklist/) and use it as a basis to improve your campaign.
