So, you’ve finished school, varsity or if you’re a politician, clown college. If so inclined, you might decide to embrace your entrepreneurial side.  There is a long road ahead, filled with late nights, strong coffee and a few tears shed. Through trial and error, regardless of the sector you have decided to enter, success may not be guaranteed, but you are going to learn a thing or two. It is more than likely, as a first-time business owner, you will receive a fair share of the dreaded … Criticism!

Now, the million-dollar question is, what do you do, or how do you react to such a thing? 

The corresponding answer may just define your chances of success, especially as a budding business mogul.

First off, where will you encounter critiques? 

Its important to understand the source of a critique. It may come from your inner circle or a long-time confidant. You may find a business partner, customer, supplier, or employee levelling a grievance your way, hell, a Youtuber™ might rant about the operation.  Whether you stay home, or travel abroad, you are probably going to encounter some form of criticism.

The problem is humans are naturally averse to criticism.

No need to deny it, not a single living soul enjoys being told that they are wrong, with a special knee jerk reaction when its towards personal ventures. This very much applies to new entrepreneurial ventures. Fear not, there is light at the end of this tunnel, no train in sight. 
How do you Differentiate between positive and negative criticism?

As a young entrepreneur it is vital to differentiate between positive and negative criticism. A better way to phrase this this is “constructive” vs “negative” critiques.

Constructive criticism will often come from those who genuinely want you to succeed, although, it may not always be fun to hear.  it is important to accept criticism if the following criteria has been met:
- From a person that has shown themselves to play a positive role in your life, whether as a parent, sibling, friend, or mentor. In rare cases it may be a perfect stranger, who offers a hint “helpful tips or words of wisdom often make-eth the entrepreneur “.
- They have sufficient experience or training in the field or sector being critiqued.
- Present the critique as an opportunity to improve.
- Offer a stepwise solution on said improvement, possibly in the form of guidance. 

Unfortunately, there is also negative criticism, a lot of it in this world, which to be frank, should be taken with a spoon full of salt or shot of Jägermeister ™. It is crucial to thicken your skin to the following types of “critiques” with the following red flags:

- From a person that has shown themselves to play a generally negative role in your life, whether abusive, belittling, dangerous, hostile, or envious. This can take forms of friends and family, as well as the garden variety Karen.
- Present the problem as a “dead-end” or an impassable barrier to success or personal growth.
- Simply said to inflict an emotional response “think character assassination “ 
- Is a veiled or direct insult, nothing more “this was stupid!”

With all this in mind, it’s vital for a young entrepreneur to be open to criticism, it is a major tool in self-improvement, which if it needs to be spelt out: leads down the pathway to success. In a world that has become increasingly averse to self-reflection, it is the job of the young entrepreneur to break the mould, its time to start building your empire.
