It’s no secret that every business needs to have a successful website to succeed, but the art of generating traffic and building loyal audiences has become more nuanced in today’s landscape. The oversaturation of the internet with content and websites has made it more difficult to stand out in the crowd, and the competitive race to the top of Google’s page-one search results is now more complicated than ever before.

There are a lot of factors to consider to make sure you are doing everything you can to increase traffic to your website. From high-speed performance to content clean-up, many variables can impact your site’s traffic. Here are some tips to ensure you’re generating the most traffic possible to your website.

## Write long-form content

Long-form content increases organic traffic by attracting more backlinks and social shares. When a piece of content is comprehensive, valuable, and well-researched, other websites and influencers are more likely to reference and link to it.

These backlinks signal search engines that the content is authoritative, leading to higher search rankings and increased organic traffic. Moreover, longer articles tend to cover multiple subtopics and answer various user queries, broadening their appeal and visibility in search results.

As the content gains traction, it generates more social media shares and engagement, further amplifying its reach and driving additional organic traffic to the website.

## Use short and descriptive URLs

Improving your URL structure can have a significant impact on your on-page SEO with minimal effort. A clean URL aids search engines in understanding your page and provides a more user-friendly appearance in the SERPs.

Best of all, it's relatively easy to accomplish, even for SEO beginners.

An effective URL should:

- **Use keywords**: Try to include your primary keyword, if possible.
- **Be readable**: When visitors read the URL, it should be easy for them to understand the page's content.
- **Be concise**: Shorter URLs (around 60 characters) are preferable. Longer URLs may not be processed effectively by some search engines, potentially resulting in lower rankings.

## Analyse your keywords gaps

Analysing a keyword gap can significantly improve organic traffic by identifying untapped opportunities to target relevant keywords that competitors are ranking for, but your website isn't. This process involves comparing the keywords your website currently ranks for with those of your competitors, revealing gaps where you lack visibility.

By addressing these gaps, you can create new content or optimise existing pages to target these specific keywords. This strategy diversifies your keyword portfolio and allows you to capture more search traffic from users seeking related information. Additionally, targeting keywords with less competition but decent search volume can lead to quicker rankings and increased visibility.

## Fix technical SEO issues

Fixing technical SEO issues can significantly increase organic traffic by enhancing your website's visibility and user experience. Technical SEO focuses on optimising the website's structure and performance for search engines, making it easier for them to crawl and index your content. By resolving issues such as broken links, duplicate content, and slow loading times, search engines can better understand and rank your pages, leading to higher positions in search results.

A well-optimised website also provides a smoother user experience, reducing bounce rates and encouraging visitors to explore more pages. This improved user engagement sends positive signals to search engines, further boosting your rankings. Moreover, technical SEO ensures that your site is mobile-friendly, catering to the growing number of mobile users and improving your chances of appearing in mobile search results.

## Update pages ranked below the top 10

As the old adage goes “the best place to hide a dead body is on page 2 of Google”. In fact, only 0.62% of Google users continue on to page two to find what they need. However, just because a page has ranked below the top 10 for a while, doesn’t mean it needs to be thrown in the bin.

Updating existing content is an excellent way of increasing organic traffic to your website. Improve landing pages by:

- Adding missing subtopics
- Refreshing outdated information
- Including an FAQ section with questions from Google's People Also Ask box
- Improving content readability (cutting irrelevant content, simplifying language, adding visuals)
- Adding free resources (templates, checklists, etc)
- Implementing internal links for better navigation and user experience.
- Improving product descriptions (e-commerce)

Compile a list of pages that need to be updated, make the changes and watch your organic traffic increase.
