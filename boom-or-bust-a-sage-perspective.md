We’ve all heard the expressions before: back in my day, kids these days, and those were the days. The ongoing consensus amongst the older generation is that the next generation lacks the ability to undertake the reins of business. The reasons for this vary from person to person, from accusations of laziness or to criticise a lack of aptitude or understanding of the matter.

Where does this lack of faith in the younger generation stem from?

If we take a step back and look at the older generation, specifically what they faced more so what they overcame. Boomers are defined as the generation born just after World War 2 ended. This point in history is often considered to be one of the greatest economic booms in history. War rationing and fascism were largely consigned when taking into account many increases in socio-economic living standards for many of the western world.

The bright outlook is often evidenced by the off handed remarks from parents such as, “I bought my first home when I was in my 20s” or “University is nonsense - all I needed was my high school diploma for a great job.” It’s hard to berate boomers too harshly for having these sentiments, after all it wasn’t their fault that times were good, war scars were plenty and people wanted to move past them with such urgency and momentum that it launched the generation into a state of socio economic productivity.

Now let’s get groovy with the new kids on the block - Gen X.

Generation X are the true rebels without a cause. By the 70s the economic stream of post war society had begun to slow while also seeing significant changes in society. The turbulence of this period bred a generation of angsty, hard working blue collar workers. The post war economic explosion may have run out of gas but the wide ideological split between the East and the West created a new kind of… boom. One that paved the way for a generation that arguably did even better than their parents.

This generation saw some of the greatest economic successes as well as the largest crashes. To paint a picture, imagine bespoke Wall Street brokers in front of a white mountain contrasted to the infamy of a homeless epidemic crisis rampant with drug abuse. Gen X arguably holds the coveted title of both recovering and recuperating wealth after several economic downturns, a feat generally not replicated by the other generations. Not to be repetitive, but a little anger can be directed at the apparent ease of X’s successes.

Did you think we were going to forget about Millennials and Generation Z? Not a chance.

Millennials are a different animal all together thanks to the variables at play. The kids who had access to personal computing technology like desktops, laptops and phones with cellular networks. Millennials saw the rise of an information rich digital environment paired with never-before-seen industry opportunities in IT, e-commerce and software.

However the sunshine and roses attached to Google accessibility has been overshadowed by the dot-com burst, recession, a global housing crisis and an insane hike in the overall cost of living. Aha! Mystery solved; this may in part contribute to the somewhat disgruntled outlook the youngsters have. This parallels with Generation Z, AKA the “digital natives” who have greater social awareness.

The generational divide is sadly growing, and it seems to be a result of a largely unaddressed series of misunderstandings. The take home is that every generation has endured some strange set of challenges and circumstances, as well as unique opportunities for those with the willingness and means to seize it. We share so many similarities and differences that it could almost be likened to a sitcom with each generation with their own quirky characters. We would hope each era shares their collective experiences with their successors, while learning and adapting how they are going to innovate for the future.
The youngsters may have more to offer than the old timers initially think. Only through the acceptance of all parties and combined efforts from all generations can we truly pave a future fit for all.
